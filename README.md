It is currently not working since the university took away the server that hosted the database used, so unless you use a separate database on a separate server following the ER diagram, CREATE & INSERT statements on the attached pdfs the application will not be able to log in. If you wish to view the application functionalities they are all covered on the pdf manual and memory (the project docs).
